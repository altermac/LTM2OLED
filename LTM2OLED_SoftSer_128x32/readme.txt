Combined LTM2OLED and Artificial Horizon for SSD1306 OLED with LTMReader Class

This sketch is made for a small ESP 8266 D1 board and a smal 0.91" OLED (128x32 pixel).

The code ist optimized for OLED with only 32 pixel height. An OLED with 64 pixel height 
will still work, but only half of the screen will be used.
 
The code will also work with other boards that support a softserial connection. Feel 
free to look in the other sketch-folders of this github repository for additional pdf-files 
with information on wiring and additional code.
